# Blossom Opt-in Feature Box script #

*Description:* Blossom is an attention grabbing feature box that conditionally pops up at the center of the user's screen for maximum visibility and user engagement. It can be used as the classic opt-in box to capture user's email, or simply to display important content such as an announcement or even an advertisement. Here's a list of Blossom's features:

+ Fully responsive feature box that displays itself in the center of the user's browser screen regardless of screen size.  Box resizes fluidly as browser size changes.
+ Five different effects out of the box to reveal the feature box- "swing", "slidedown", "starwars", "newspaper", and "wiggle".
+ Markup for feature box can either by inline on the page, or defined inside an external txt file and fetched via Ajax.
+ Ability to manually open the Feature Box again after it's been closed by calling a public method of the script.
+ Optional scroll based delivery- feature box can be shown only when the user has scrolled the document by a certain percentage, such as 50% or 100% (when the user is at the end of the page).
+ Robust frequency control- limit the display of the feature box to avoid annoying users- once per session, every 5 minutes, 10 hours, or 30 days etc. It's  up to you.

The script works in IE7+ and all modern browsers, with lower end IE browsers showing a more limited interface without any special effects.
